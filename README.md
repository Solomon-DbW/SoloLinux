# SoloLinux
My own attempt to create a user-friendly Linux experience through a post-installation script and an Arch-based distro that I made using archiso.

## WARNING
- Install post install script by running `sudo pacman -S sololinux-post-install`
- For post install script tarball, visit https://solomon-dbw.github.io/SoloLinux/repo/<!-- - Run `rm -rf ~/.config/emacs/elpaca` for Emacs config to work. -->
- `tmuxconffile` is just ~/.tmux.conf, and you'll need to install the Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm) for it to work
- `zshrcfie` is just ~/.zshrc, and you'll need to install Oh-My-Zsh for it to work
