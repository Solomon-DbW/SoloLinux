# SoloLinux
An Arch-based distro/post-install script that I made using archiso.

## WARNING
- Run `rm -rf ~/.config/emacs/elpaca` for Emacs config to work.
- `tmuxconffile` is just ~/.tmux.conf, and you'll need to install the Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm) for it to work
- `zshrcfie` is just ~/.zshrc, and you'll need to install Oh-My-Zsh for it to work
